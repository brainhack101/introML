## Machine learning for neuroimaging ...
##   ... with Scikit-learn and nilearn

**Team:** Pierre Bellec, Elizabeth DuPre, Greg Kiar, Jacob Vogel

**Date:** December 12th, 9h-17h. Breakfast/registration at 8h30.

**Location:** Amphithéâtre “le groupe Maurice”, CRIUGM

**Summary:** This course will be a hands-on/type-along introduction to machine learning for neuroimaging problems with scikit-learn and nilearn.

### Morning (9h-12h30): introduction to machine-learning with scikit-learn

This part of the course will follow the scikit-learn chapter of the scipy-lectures, found [here](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/packages/scikit-learn/index.html). This includes:
- Basic principles
- Supervised learning: classification, the example of handwritten digits
- Supervised learning: regression, the example of housing data
- Measuring prediction performance
- Unsupervised learning: dimension reduction and visualization
- Chaining estimators: the example of eigenfaces
- Parameter selection, validation, and testing

### Afternoon (13h30-17h): introduction to nilearn

This part of the course will provide a general introduction to nilearn, building off of [several example analyses](http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/index.html#general-examples).

### Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with Python would be preferable
- You will need enough space for Anaconda and all the course data (~5GB).

If you are already savvy with Python and just want a tl;dr summary, here’s all you need to know:

1. Join the [Brainhack Slack](https://brainhack-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/) group and join the [main-nilearn-2018](https://brainhack.slack.com/messages/CEQB7U15M/) channel 
2. Download and install python with the full-suite 64-bit [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution
3. Download the [data](https://osf.io/5hju4/files/) and remember where you store it!
4. Download or clone the Intro to ML [repository](https://github.com/brainhack101/introML)
5. Install the necessary packages: `pip install nilearn scipy matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter pandas seaborn`
6. Test everything by opening one of the MAIN-tutorial .ipynb notebooks and running the first few cells
