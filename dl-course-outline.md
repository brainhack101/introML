## Deep Learning for Neuroimaging 

**Team:** Andrew Doyle, Joseph Paul Cohen, Thomas Funck, Christopher Beckham

**Date:** December 11th, 9h-17h. Breakfast/registration at 8h30.

**Location:** Amphithéâtre “le groupe Maurice”, CRIUGM

**Summary:** Deep learning is one of the most promising avenues towards achieving artificial general intelligence, and a strong new tool for the analysis of neuroimaging data. This course will offer an introduction into the theory behind how representations are automatically learned from data, and offer students an introduction into how to use the Keras library to formulate and solve a variety of deep learning problems using hands-on examples.

**Learning Objectives:**
* Understand how **representations are learned** in deep neural networks
* Implement a **convolutional neural network** in Keras on neuroimaging data
* Learn how **embeddings** can be learned

### Requirements
* Basic familiarity with programming in Python is an asset, but not a requirement.
* Examples will be presented in Google Collaboratory, and participants should create a Google account to run & write code along with the instructors: https://colab.research.google.com.
* For students who wish to continue their analyses after the course, Python 3.x should be installed (ideally through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)) with the [Keras](https://keras.io/) package.
